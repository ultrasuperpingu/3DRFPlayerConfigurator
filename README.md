# 3DRFPlayerConfigurator
RFPlayer configurator

The software propose almost the same features than the original Java RFPlayer configurator. But it does not need Java and it propose a 3D view of the RFPlayer module...
## Features
 * Edit settings of the module
 * Console mode with documentation
 * Send command form
 * Parrot learning form with learnt messages
 * Firmware update
 * Detect and decode EV1527 (and PT2262) frames (if RFLink enabled)

## Command Line Arguments
 * You can specify the log file with -logFile (ex: 3D RFPlayer Configurator.exe -logFile log.txt)
 * You can specify the serial port to use (by default, the software scan all ports) with --port (ex: 3D RFPlayer Configurator.exe --port COM2)

## Why 3D ?
Possible answers:
 * Why not?
 * Because I can
 * It was fun to do
 * It could be useful for interactive help (maybe?, some day?)
